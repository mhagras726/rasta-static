    <p><strong>1. No Guarantee of Detection</strong><br>
    The gunshot detector is designed to assist in identifying gunshot events. However, detection accuracy may vary due to environmental noise, installation conditions, or device configuration.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Limitations of Service</strong><br>
    Functionality may be affected by internet failures, power loss, or acoustic interference. Notifications may be delayed or missed entirely under certain conditions.</p>

        <li>False alerts (false positive)</li>
        <li>Delays in alerts due to network or system errors</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4. User Responsibility</strong><br>
